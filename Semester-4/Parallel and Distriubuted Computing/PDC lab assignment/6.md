In this code, we first define the matrices A, B, and C as global variables. We also define a `struct` called `thread_args` to hold the row and column indices of a matrix element that a thread will initialize or calculate. 

We then define two thread functions: `init_matrix` for initializing matrix elements, and `calc_matrix` for calculating matrix elements. Both functions take a `void *` argument, which is cast to a `struct thread_args` pointer to get the row and column indices. 

In `init_matrix`, we use the `rand()` function to generate a random integer between 0 and 9 and assign it to the corresponding element of matrices A and B. 

In `calc_matrix`, we first initialize the corresponding element of matrix C to 0. We then use a loop to calculate the dot product of the row of matrix A and the column of matrix B, and assign the result to the corresponding element of matrix C.

In the `main` function, we create two arrays of threads: `init_threads` for initializing matrices A and B, and `calc_threads` for calculating matrix C. We also create two arrays of `thread_args` structs to hold the thread arguments.

We then use nested `for` loops to create threads for initializing matrices A and B, and threads for calculating matrix C. We set the row and column indices of each matrix element as thread arguments, and call `pthread_create` to create a thread for each matrix element.

After all initialization and calculation threads have been created, we use `pthread_join` to wait for them to finish. Finally, we print the matrices A, B, and C to the console.
