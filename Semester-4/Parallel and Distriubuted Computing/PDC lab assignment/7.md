```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

#define ARRAY_SIZE 5
#define NUM_THREADS 5
```

These are the include statements and two preprocessor macros defined to represent the size of the arrays and the number of threads to create.

```c
int array1[ARRAY_SIZE] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int array2[ARRAY_SIZE] = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
int result[ARRAY_SIZE] = {0};
```
These lines declare the two arrays to be added (array1 and array2) and an array to store the result of the addition (result). They are initialized with sample data.

```c
void *add_arrays(void *arg) {
    int thread_id = *(int*) arg;
    int start = thread_id * ARRAY_SIZE / NUM_THREADS;
    int end = (thread_id + 1) * ARRAY_SIZE / NUM_THREADS;

    for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
        result[i] = array1[i] + array2[i];
    }

    pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```

This is the function that each thread will execute. It takes a void pointer argument arg which we cast to an integer to obtain the thread ID. It then calculates the starting and ending indices of the array elements to be added by this thread. It then iterates over the specified range and performs the addition operation on each element, storing the result in the result array. Finally, the thread exits.

```c
int main() {
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
    int thread_ids[NUM_THREADS];

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        thread_ids[i] = i;
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, add_arrays, (void*) &thread_ids[i]);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    printf("Resultant Array:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        printf("%d ", result[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```
This is the main function of the program. It first declares an array of pthread_t structures to hold the thread IDs and another array of integers to hold the thread IDs themselves. Then it creates 5 threads using a for loop. For each thread, it assigns a unique ID from the thread_ids array, creates the thread using pthread_create, passing in the add_arrays function as the thread function and the thread ID as its argument. Once all the threads are created, it waits for each thread to finish using another for loop and pthread_join. Finally, it prints the result array and returns 0 to indicate success.
