    " a. All non-final states are in one EC, say NF\n",

    "     * \"Evolved through\" means $\\hat{\\delta}(sa,\\varepsilon) = sa$, and similarly for sb\n",
    "     \n",
    "     * In our example DFA d34bl, IF is zero-distinguishable from all other states\n",
    " \n",

    " a. Take a state pair $(s_1,s_2)$ such that they are not $k$ distinguishable.\n",
    " b. Take $c\\in\\Sigma$\n",
    " c. If $\\delta(s_1,c) = sn_1$ and $\\delta(s_2,c) = sn_2$ and $(sn_1,sn_2)$ are $k$-distinguishable, mark $(s_1,s_2)$ as $k+1$-distinguishable. \n",
    " \n",
    "4. Repeat the above process till across one sweep, the distinguishability relation does not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Take all maximal sets of pairs of states that have not been found distinguishable yet. Pick a representative from each such maximal set. These states are in the final DFA. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Go by the state transitions of the representative states. (The remaining states in the equivalence classes are not necessary.)\n",
